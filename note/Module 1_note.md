- A **successful data science consultant** requires a wide range of skills, including domain knowledge, business acumen, analytical thinking & problem-solving, teamwork & project management, communication & presentation, machine learning, big data, and software development. 

## Analytics Roadmap to Impact

- 重要的不是data insight, model techniques, 而是如何让你的ds project activate within business & many people are using it
- How to **get full value** of data analytics approaches?
- Framework: 
  - **Business Problem & Value**: make sure getting right problem for business before dive in; may work on wrong problem
    - get problem right & get us understand--NOT TRIVIAL!
    - interview the clients, **ask them key questions**: 
    - Challenge: then give me **context** of their business problem/what's **really going on in the marketplace** that caused their product to start to fail
      - eg: **competitor changed the game**: *Citibank* comes up with similar product but with much lower interest rate
    - Economic: economic levers 杠杆 翘板--that really matter to their business
      - eg: *Capital One*: **size of audience** interested in their product; actual price of their product(if 0 percent rate: hurt revenue--wrong direction 所以不能像竞品一样change from 1.5 percent to 0 percent)
    - Barriers: prevent clients from solving problems immediately
      - eg: **government regulation**
        - *Capital One* since the credit card is preapproved for anyone who saw it-->therefore need government's regulatory approval
      - eg: **Economics of the situation doesn't work** 公司的经济条件不允许！/ **management** doesn't allow you to match competitive offer! 
        - eg: *Citibank* just enter the market & willing to take loss vs *Capital One*: CAP=1 was required by their **management** to be profitable
      - Gaps: what information/data gap, if could address, would influence the economic lever
        - eg: info about competitors: who beyond *citibank*is offering 0 percent offer
      - Analytics: 什么分析模型we need to build?
        - **targeting** model **(predictive model)**? target the right consumers? 
        - **Insight and descriptive analytics** (get info from data) that described the situations & **help us design the product**?
      - Influence: does problem posed by client require **refinement/breakdown/expansion/pivot from symptom表面的现象/症状 to root cause内在原因/ from incremental增加增长 to breakthrough 创新突破**
        - eg *Capital one VS Citibank* 表面是一个credit card的产品受到了competition; **实际how many other products** *Citibank* introduced now is undermining your core products?
        - from **core problem**-->expand to **all situations**
  - **Data Universe**
  -  Model Development & Insight: advanced ML, more basic logistic regression, NLP
    - 不要直接jump进method！先get problem right--> get data right!
  - **Insight to Action**: get clients excited about taking action
  - **Adopt and Implement:** getting the adoption across whole business
  - **SMART** Goals: how to make the goals from clients/boss/even ourselves more SMART?--> **refinement** of goals: more action oriented; **every aspect of the goal** can be refined & improved
    - **S**: Specific
      - what are we actually trying to accomplish with this goal?
      - 细分细分再细分 但也不能too specific!
      - eg: increase Revenue-->**more regionally relevant**: Increase Revenue by 12-15% within US; > 20% for EMEA; > 30% in APAC(ASIA)
    - **M:** Measurable
      - how will we know when the goal is accomplished?
      - 不要单说increase revenue-->break it down into **specific market performance/key performance indicators KPI** ( <u>metrics/levers</u> that we can actually pull to improve things)
        - **audience size** (from 5M to 6M)
        - **CTR**--click through rate (from 1% to 1.2%) often in **digital media**
        - **ROI** (from 200% to 240%)
        - 
    - **A**: Actionable/Attainable(如果能specify出action 说明是both actionable & attainable!)
      - **potential action/plan/initiatives** to achieve the better metrics
      - eg: change **marketing approach** to 1:1 with unique tailored message driven by predictive model vs a creative message that's **one size fits all** for the whole audience
      - eg: put name & specific products recommended for you
      - eg: slightly different interest rate; product is designed based on your specific **credit risk**
    - **R**: Relevant
      - Make sure the goal that gone through "Specific & Measurable & Actionable" pipeline is **still achieving the original intent** of the goal
      - go back & have a discussion with client/boss
    - **T**: Timebound
      - 将目标**分解**：**明确要在60天/90天以内**完成第一个目标-->know we are **on the right track** so that we can iterate and move forward
      - 不要是一年/两年的目标
